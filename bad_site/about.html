                        About me, I am a junior developer from Edmonton, with a particular interest in video games, and video game development. I will be graduating from the University of Alberta this year with a Specialization in Computing Science. Programming in itself, and the challenges that it brings I find can be fun and exciting to tackle once you're in the thick of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When it comes to development, I prefer working as part of a structured team with outlined roles as I find that it greatly improves speed and quality of work over several individuals working alone and then piecing what they have together.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Outside of school, my hobbies include playing video games competitively and casually. I also enjoy the Trading Card Game, Magic the Gathering, though admittedly I'm not very good at it!
